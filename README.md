# MATH1560J-Honors-Calculus
As the TA of MATH1560J Honors Calculus I II, I crafted a comprehensive complement to course contents.

Topics:

1. Functions Revisited in Complex
2. Integration Techniques
3. Parametric Equations and Polar Coordinates
4. Generating Functions and Infinite Series

The documents would not only save time for exercise searching and problem shooting, but moreover hopefully make a great difference in students' maths thinking and knowledge structure.
